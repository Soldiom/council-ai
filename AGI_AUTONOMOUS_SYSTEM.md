    "task": "Identify speaker in audio",
    "input": "audio_file.wav",
    "prediction": "Speaker: John Doe (94% confidence)",
    "correction": "Speaker: Jane Doe (human verified)",
    "error_type": "misidentification",
    "timestamp": "2025-11-07T10:30:00Z"
}
```

### Fine-Tuning Loop

    def assess_confidence(self, task, output):
        # Estimate confidence based on:
        # 1. Model agreement (multiple models)
        # 2. Historical accuracy (similar tasks)
        # 3. Output uncertainty (model scores)
        
        if confidence < 0.7:
            return "REQUEST_HUMAN_REVIEW"
        elif confidence < 0.9:

    "output": "Identity: John Doe (96% confidence)",
    "risk_level": "high",
    "human_approved": true,
    "approver": "user@example.com",
    "reasoning": "High confidence match on face and voice"
}
```

### Governance Roles
- **System Administrator**: Configure guardrails, review logs
- **Domain Expert**: Provide corrections, validate outputs

## 🎯 ARC-AGI Benchmark Integration

### What is ARC-AGI?
"The intelligence of a system is a measure of its skill-acquisition efficiency over a scope of tasks, with respect to priors, experience, and generalization difficulty."

### How We Measure
1. **Skill Acquisition**: How quickly system learns new tasks
2. **Generalization**: Performance on unseen tasks
3. **Prior Knowledge**: Leverage existing models/data
4. **Efficiency**: Examples needed to reach proficiency

### Implementation
```python
def arc_agi_benchmark(system, new_task):
    # 1. Present new task (no training)
    result_zero_shot = system.solve(new_task, examples=0)
    
    # 2. Provide few examples
    result_few_shot = system.solve(new_task, examples=5)
    
    # 3. Calculate metrics
    skill_acquisition = improvement(result_zero_shot, result_few_shot)
    generalization = result_few_shot.accuracy
    efficiency = 1 / examples_needed
    
    arc_score = skill_acquisition * generalization * efficiency
    
    return arc_score  # Target: >0.85 (AGI-level)
```
